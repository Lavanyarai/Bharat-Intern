# Virtual Data Science Internship with Bharat Intern

## Project 1-  Stock Prediction
Predicting stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

### Description
This project leverages the power of LSTM neural networks to forecast stock prices of any company of your choice. By utilizing historical stock price data, the model makes predictions based on patterns and trends in the data. The code for this project is available in Jupyter Notebook for transparency and ease of understanding.


## Project 2- Titanic Classification
Predicting survival on the Titanic and identifying key factors.

### Description
In this project, we explore the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. We investigate various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to determine which attributes were most likely to lead to a successful outcome. This classification task provides insights into the historical tragedy.


## How to Use
1. **Stock Prediction**: Open the Jupyter Notebook to analyze and predict stock prices for your chosen company. Follow the code and comments for guidance.

2. **Titanic Classification**: Explore the Jupyter Notebook to understand the factors affecting Titanic passenger survival. Analyze the code and results to gain insights into this historical event.

Feel free to clone or download this repository to explore the code and data analysis in detail. Happy coding!
