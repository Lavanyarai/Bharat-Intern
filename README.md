# Stock Prediction and Titanic Classification

## Stock Prediction
Predicting stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

### Description
This project leverages the power of LSTM neural networks to forecast stock prices of any company of your choice. By utilizing historical stock price data, the model makes predictions based on patterns and trends in the data. The code for this project is available in Jupyter Notebook for transparency and ease of understanding.

### Features
- LSTM-based stock price prediction.
- Flexibility to choose any company's stock for analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook for clear code presentation and visualization.

## Titanic Classification
Predicting survival on the Titanic and identifying key factors.

### Description
In this project, we explore the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. We investigate various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to determine which attributes were most likely to lead to a successful outcome. This classification task provides insights into the historical tragedy.

### Features
- Classification model to predict Titanic passenger survival.
- Analysis of factors influencing survival.
- Insights into socio-economic status, age, and gender disparities.

## How to Use
