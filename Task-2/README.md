# Titanic Passenger Survival Classification

## Task Description
The primary objective of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. We employ classification techniques to determine whether a passenger is likely to survive or not based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. This task offers insights into understanding the factors that played a crucial role in passenger survival during this historic tragedy.

## Features
- **Classification Modeling**: The task involves building classification models to predict whether a passenger survived or not. This analysis can provide valuable insights into historical events.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We explore and visualize the Titanic dataset to understand the distribution of various features and their impact on survival rates.

- **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract meaningful information from the dataset and improve the model's predictive performance.

- **Insightful Analysis**: The task aims to identify key factors, such as socio-economic status, age, and gender, that contributed to passenger survival, offering a deeper understanding of the historical context.

- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of data are included to aid in comprehending the dataset and model results.

Feel free to explore this task's code and analysis to gain insights into passenger survival patterns on the Titanic. Happy exploring!
